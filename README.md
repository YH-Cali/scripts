KNLab Scripts
=============

Miscellaneous scripts used in the [Kris Niyogi lab][1] at UC Berkeley.
Some might be well-documented, some might be useful, but nothing is guaranteed!
Each lab member has their own setup, so check the README in their subfolder for instructions.

| script | description |
|:-------|:------------|
| [GrowthCurveFunctions](tim/) | Functions for Zofingeiensis growth curves
| [led-array-programs](jeff/led-array-programs/) | Describe a pattern of light levels in Python, and this writes a program for our custom growth chamber LED arrays
| [pbr-web-monitor](jeff/pbr-web-monitor/) | Remote plotting of photobioreactor data + email alerts when conditions go out of bounds
| [pcc7942-cpf1-primers](jeff/pcc7942-cpf1-primers/) | Generates initial primers to order for editing the PCC 7942 genome with CRISPR/Cpf1
| [plate-map-merge](jeff/plate-map-merge/) | Merges multiple plate maps into one big tidy metadata table
| [plate-map-table](jeff/plate-map-table/) | Converts 2D plate maps to long format (rows)
| [qrcode-labels](jeff/qrcode-labels/) | Generates sheets of random QR codes to print on labels
| [tecan-absorbance-scans](jeff/tecan-absorbance-scans/) | Plots absorbance scans from Tecan data
| [tecan-extract-table](jeff/tecan-extract-table/) | Convert Excel spreadsheets generated by Tecan plate readers into tidy data for plotting in R
| [tecan-growth-curves](jeff/tecan-growth-curves/) | High-throughput growth curves using the Tecan plate reader
| [tecan-merge-metadata](jeff/tecan-merge-metadata/) | Merges the outputs of `plate-map-merge` and `tecan-extract-table`
| [tnseq-growth-curves](jeff/tnseq-growth-curves/) | Plots doublings given a spreadsheet of OD measurements and a list of treatments
