Merges Tecan readings with plate metadata. Expects one metadata table in
the format produced by mergemeta, and one or more sets of tecan readings
in the format produced by tecan-extract-table.

Tecan readings that don't match any of described wells will be silently
ignored, because that makes it "just work" with a glob of all files from
tecan-extract-table. If you're not sure the right ones are being loaded, turn
up verbosity to check.

Usage:
  tecan-merge-metadata [(-v|-vv|-vvv) --out <outcsv>] --meta <meta> <tecan> ...
  tecan-merge-metadata (-h | --help)

Options:
  -h --help          Show this screen.

  -v                 Increase the logging verbosity. Use once for warnings,
                     twice for info, and three times for debugging.

  -o --out <outcsv>  Write the outcsv CSV to a file. If none, prints to stdout.

  -m --meta <meta>   A spreadsheet that lists metadata for each well of each
                     plate. Can be all sorts of things: strain, start time,
                     volume, antibiotic concentration, temperature, treatment
                     label, etc.

  <tecan>            Tecan file to parse and merge with the plate metadata.
                     Plate IDs are detected based on Tecan filename + sheet
                     name + measurement label (set in iControl/Magellan). This
                     part is a little brittle; make sure to name the files
                     correctly!
