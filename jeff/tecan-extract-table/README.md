Extract tidy tables from Tecan Excel files
==========================================

This is an update to my old `tecan2csv` script. It extracts Tecan readings from
their native Excel files and puts them in one big tidy table. Different Tecan
readings have different formats, so you need to give the ones you want to
extract a consistent label in Excel first.

TODO explain how to format the excel files to work with plate metadata
