Converts the Excel spreadsheets generated by Tecan plate readers to "tidy" data
that's easy to work with in R. Afterward, you can add metadata with mergetecan.

Usage:
  tecan-extract-table [(-v|-vv|-vvv) --out=<outcsv>] --label=<label> <tecan> ...
  tecan-extract-table (-h|--help)

Options:
  -h --help           Show this screen.

  -v                  Increase verbosity. Use once for warnings, twice for
                      info, and three times for debugging.

  -o --out <outcsv>   Where to save the tidy CSV file. If none, prints to stdout.

  -l --label <label>  The label for measurements you want to extract. This is
                      set in iControl/Magellan. It's necessary because the same
                      file can contain various measurements, and mixing them in
                      the same csv file would (without some extra logic) cause
                      errors later.

  <tecan>             Tecan file(s) to parse. Note that this doesn't work with
                      all possible Tecan measurements! I've only written parsers
                      for the readings I actually use. But it's easy to add
                      a new one when needed (just a short Python function).
