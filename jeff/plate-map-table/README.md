Expand plate maps to long-format tables
=======================================

This is a very simple script... mostly a test of packaging and docopt.
It just reads files in 2D "plate map" format and writes a long ("tidy")
table for easier use in R. Normally you would use it with [tecan-merge-metadata][3].

It makes more sense if you read [tecan-absorbance-scans][1] or
[tecan-growth-curves][2] first.

[1]: ../tecan-absorbance-scans/
[2]: ../tecan-growth-curves/
[3]: ../tecan-merge-metadata/
