Expand plate maps to long-format tables
=======================================

This is a very simple script... mostly a test of packaging and docopt to be
honest. It just reads files in 2D "plate map" format and writes a long ("tidy")
table for easier use in R. Normally you would use it with
[tecan-merge-metadata](../tecan-merge-metadata/).
