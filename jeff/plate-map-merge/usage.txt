Merges multiple plate metadata files into one comprehensive table. Expects
a very particular format which is best understood by looking at some examples.

Usage:
  plate-map-merge [(-v|-vv|-vvv) --out <outcsv>] --plate <plate> <map> ...
  plate-map-merge (-h | --help)

Options:
  -h --help           Show this screen.

  -v                  Increase verbosity. Use once for warnings, twice for
                      info, and three times for debugging.


  -o --out <outcsv>   Write the outcsv CSV to a file. If none, prints to
                      stdout.

  -p --plate <plate>  A CSV file with plate metadata (ID, start time,
                      conditions, etc.)

  <map>               A CSV file that expands a platecsv with per-well
                      metadata. You need one of these per metadata field per
                      plate (but they can be reused if multiple plates
                      follow the same pattern). You'll almost always want
                      these to label strains, and sometimes other things
                      that vary like start time, volume, or antibiotic
                      concentration.

                      Note that mapcsvs need to be named according to the
                      plate ID + metadata field they expand on. This part is
                      a little brittle; you need to make sure to name the
                      files correctly!
