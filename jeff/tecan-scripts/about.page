title: Updated Tecan scripts
...

These needed some work to bring them up to date as far as my experimental
setup, and they also weren't the best-documented or sanest scripts before.
From now on I'll try to make everything its own separate Nix package with
its own command line interface + help text (access with `--help`). That
should go a long way toward promoting reuse.

TidyMap
-------

The first script is more a test of packaging and docopt to be honest. It
just reads files in my 2D "grid"/"map" format and writes them out in
"tidy" format for easier use in R. It's used by `mergemeta`.

TidyTecan
---------

This is an update to my old `tecan2csv`. It extracts Tecan readings from
their native Excel files and puts them in one big tidy table. You have to
filter by a label because not all Tecan readings will fit nicely together
in the same table.

MergeMeta
---------

This is a new script that I split off from `tidytecan` because it's better
written in R. It reads a table of plate metadata and expands it to
describe each well individually. The fields that are uniform across
a plate just get copied . The interesting part is that besides literal
values, the plate table can contain references (cell values starting with
`@`), and `mergemeta` will find + merge in the corresponding plate map
files. This way you can have your cake and eat it too: small plate maps
that can be visually checked for errors or printed with Excel as
a pipetting guide, but also one huge table for analysis in R!

MergeTecan
----------

This is the final step in the workflow: after making one big metadata
table with `mergemeta`, and one or more tables of Tecan readings with
`tidytecan`, this merges them. You get Tecan readings annotated with all
the relevant well metadata. Note that it drops readings that don't match
a well! If you want to make sure the right ones are kept/dropped, you
should turn up the verbosity with `-v` and it'll explain better.

Overall protocol
----------------

To prepare data from a Tecan timecourse, you should:

#. Write a table of plate metadata describing the conditions each plate is
   grown under, which antibiotics they use etc. I usually name this
   `<start date>_<experiment name>_plates.csv`.

#. For each field that doesn't fit in one cell because it varies across
   a plate, write a separate plate map and reference it from the main table.
   These files need to have names that include the *column* they appear in
   (`antibiotic`, `light`, `strain` etc) and also the identifier used in
   their cell (`p0210` if you referred to `@p0210`). I usually name them
   `<start date>_<experiment name>_<plate id>_<column name>.csv`. It sounds
   brittle, but works pretty well in practice. `mergemeta` will abort if
   a reference is ambiguous (but the error might be less than helpful).

#. Run `mergemeta` to consolidate the above files into a master metadata
   table. You only need to do this once at the beginning of the experiment,
   unless you decide to change conditions later.

#. As the timecourse progresses and you accumulate `.xlsx` files, run
   `tidytecan` on each of them. If you're measuring multiple things (I often
   do OD~750~ to track growth and also a full absorbance scan from 400 to
   800nm to track pigments), you'll want to set their labels in iControl
   or Magellan so you can extract them separately with the `--label` option.

#. At any point during or after the timecourse, you can use `mergetecan` to
   make a big table of annotated Tecan readings from your metadata table +
   readings. This is what you'll want when graphing with `ggplot` or doing
   other analyses.
