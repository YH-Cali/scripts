Merges Tecan readings with plate metadata. Expects one metadata table in
the format produced by mergemeta, and one or more sets of tecan readings
in the format produced by tidytecan.

Tecan readings that don't match any of described wells will be silently
ignored, because that makes it "just work" with a glob of all files from
tidytecan. If you're not sure the right ones are being loaded, turn up
verbosity to check.

Usage:
  mergetecan [(-v|-vv|-vvv) --out <outcsv>] --meta <meta> <tecan> ...
  mergetecan (-h | --help)

Options:
  -h --help          Show this screen.

  -v                 Increase the logging verbosity. Use once for warnings,
                     twice for info, and three times for debugging.

  -o --out <outcsv>  Write the outcsv CSV to a file. If none, prints to stdout.

  -m --meta <meta>   A spreadsheet that lists metadata for each well of each
                     plate. Can be all sorts of things: strain, start time,
                     volume, antibiotic concentration, temperature, treatment
                     label, etc.

  <tecan>            Tecan file to parse and merge with the plate metadata.
                     Plate IDs are detected based on Tecan filename + sheet
                     name + measurement label (set in iControl/Magellan). This
                     part is a little brittle; make sure to name the files
                     correctly!
